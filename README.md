 **Overview**
This project explores the Wine Quality dataset to understand the relationship between the physicochemical properties of wine and their quality ratings. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building machine learning models to predict wine quality.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains various features related to the chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH, along with a quality rating on a scale from 0 to 10.

- **Dataset Source:** [Wine Quality Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical properties (e.g., alcohol, pH, residual sugar)
- **Target:** Wine quality rating (0-10)

**Steps To Recreate Project**

1. **Data Loading**
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing values are handled, and outliers are detected and managed to ensure a high-quality dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to explore the distribution of features and their relationships with wine quality.

4. **Modeling**
   - Machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) are built to predict wine quality.
   - The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, R-squared, and classification reports.

5. **Model Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like GridSearchCV to improve model performance.

 **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Programming language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.

**Results**
The analysis provides insights into which physicochemical properties most strongly influence wine quality and demonstrates the effectiveness of different predictive models.
